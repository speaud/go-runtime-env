__note: this is a sandbox-esque project atm__

This is bare bones. Includes a containerized development environment play with Golang in a "live reload-esque," manner.

Meaning, I start up a instance of this repo. After I make a change to the code base, a message is sent to update/re-render the running instance.

To run `docker-compose up --build`
