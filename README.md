__note: this is a sandbox-esque project atm__

This is bare bones. Includes a containerized development environment to play with Golang with a "live reload-esque," developer experience.

Meaning, after you stand up a instance of this repo. You then make a change to the code base then a message is sent to update/re-render the running instance where after I can immediately see this change in the browser.

To run `docker-compose up --build`
